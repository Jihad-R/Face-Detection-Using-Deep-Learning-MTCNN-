# Face-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MTCNN-
Demonstrating face detection using Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network.
> The proposed CNNs consist of three stages. In the first stage, it produces candidate windows quickly through a shallow CNN. Then, it refines the windows to reject a large number of non-faces windows through a more complex CNN. Finally, it uses a more powerful CNN to refine the result and output facial landmarks positions.

# Libraries used
